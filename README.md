##Description
This agreement was put together by a U.S. homeowner renting out a room in his house with feedback from landlords at major forums and blogs. You can see their suggestions [here] [http://www.paperwell.com/docs/467-room-rental-agreement-for-homeowner-on-site/comments].  The situation for which this agreement should be used is a bit different than that of your normal landlord-tenant agreement because the homeowner and renter are sharing the same living space, so this agreement includes house rules and additional protections. It's also known as a "lodger agreement" in some countries.
